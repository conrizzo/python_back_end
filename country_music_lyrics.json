    Now Amos Moses was a Cajun
    He lived by himself in the swamp
    He hunted alligator for a living
    He'd just knock them in the head with a stump
    The Louisiana law gonna get you, Amos
    It ain't legal hunting alligator down in the swamp, boy
    Now everyone blamed his old man
    For making him mean as a snake
    When Amos Moses was a boy
    His daddy would use him for alligator bait
    Tie a rope around his base and throw him in the swamp (hahaha)
    Alligator bait in the Louisiana bayou
    About forty-five minutes southeast of Thibodaux, Louisiana
    Lived a man called Doc Millsap and his pretty wife Hannah
    Well, they raised up a son that could eat up his weight in groceries
    Named him after a man of the cloth
    Called him Amos Moses, yeah (haha)
    Now the folks from down south Louisiana
    Said Amos was a hell of a man
    He could trap the biggest, the meanest alligator
    And he'd just use one hand
    That's all he got left 'cause an alligator bit it (hahaha)
    Left arm gone clear up to the elbow
    Well the sheriff caught wind that Amos
    Was in the swamp trapping alligator skin
    So he snuck in the swamp to gon' and get the boy
    But he never come out again
    Well, I wonder where the Louisiana sheriff went to
    Well, you can sure get lost in the Louisiana bayou
    About forty-five minutes southeast of Thibodaux, Louisiana
    Lived a cat called Doc Millsap and his pretty wife Hannah
    Well, they raised up a son that could eat up his weight in groceries
    Named him after a man of the cloth
    Called him Amos Moses
    Sit down on 'em Amos!
    Make it count son
    About forty-five minutes southeast of Thibodaux, Louisiana
    Lived a man called Doc Millsap and his pretty wife Hannah"
